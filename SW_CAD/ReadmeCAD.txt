Easiest way to find subparts, is to open the HLA_Crane_Frame_Assy.SLDASM and open subparts from there.


The crane itself is bought from https://leimbach-modellbau.de/Produkte/LKW-Aufbauten/Klappladekran/09401(T)/

Because the crane had no CAD files, a rough reverse enginering was done. This was to be able to design sensor attachment, and a complete demo model with frame, in a more efficient way. Some other parts are also designed very roughly, such as power supply, PLC, Control box etc, just to give the size aspect for the design process.
